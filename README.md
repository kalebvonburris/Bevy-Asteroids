# Asteroids

Simple asteroids clone made in Bevy.

## Controls

### PC

On a keyboard, use the `w`, `a`, `s`, and `d` keys or the arrow keys to turn and move. Press space bar to shoot a bullet.

## Development and Compiling

In order to work on the code or compile it yourself, I recommend installing [Nix](https://nixos.org/download/).
This way, you can call `nix develop #.{PLATFORM}` with the environment of your choosing to compile the game for that platform.

Platforms:

- Linux: `nix develop #.default`
- Windows: `nix develop #.windows`
- Web: `nix develop #.wasm`
